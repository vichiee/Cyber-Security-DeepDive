## 🎯 Goals of Cyber Security DeepDive
- **Real-World Hands-On Learning:** Practical security projects covering cloud, DevSecOps, SOC, and AI security.
- **Interview Readiness:** Projects and case studies to help prepare for security-focused job interviews using the **STAR method**.
- **Focused Learning:** Covering **Azure Security, AWS Security, GCP Security, DLP, Firewalls**, and other key security technologies.
- **Collaboration & Contribution:** Security professionals share experiences, research, and projects.

## 📌 Featured Projects
🔹 **Azure Security:** Implementing Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, and Zero Trust in Azure, .... 
🔹 **AWS Security:** Setting up IAM, Security Hub, and threat detection in AWS, ....
🔹 **GCP Security:** Configuring security controls in Google Cloud.  
🔹 **DLP:** Implementing Data Loss Prevention strategies across cloud providers.  
🔹 **Network Security:** Implementing network security with Firewalls. 
🔹 **Firewall Security:** Designing and implementing firewall policies for cloud and hybrid environments.  

## 📖 Using the STAR Method for Projects
Each project should be structured using the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** to ensure clarity and alignment with real-world security challenges.

### **STAR Format for Projects**
Each project should be documented as follows:
1. **Situation:** Describe the real-world security challenge or problem being addressed.
2. **Task:** Define the specific security-related goal or objective to be achieved.
3. **Action:** Detail the step-by-step process used to solve the problem, including tools, configurations, and techniques.
4. **Result:** Explain the outcome, lessons learned, and potential improvements.

**Example STAR Format:**
- **Situation:** A financial services company faced unauthorized access attempts on its Azure environment.
- **Task:** Implement a Zero Trust model using Azure security controls.
- **Action:** Configured Conditional Access, enabled Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and implemented Just-In-Time (JIT) access.
- **Result:** Unauthorized access attempts were mitigated, and access policies were enforced dynamically.

All contributors should ensure their projects follow this structured format to maintain consistency and maximize learning value.
