# Cyber-Security-DeepDive
Hands-On Cybersecurity & Cloud Security Projects

🚀 About Cyber-Security-DeepDive

Cyber-Security-DeepDive is a community-driven repository focused on hands-on cybersecurity and cloud security projects. It serves as a learning hub for security professionals, and engineers looking to build real-world security knowledge and prepare for technical interviews.

🎯 Goals of Cyber-Security-DeepDive

Real-World Hands-On Learning: Practical security projects covering cloud, DevSecOps, SOC, and AI security.

Interview Readiness: Projects and case studies to help prepare for security-focused job interviews using the STAR method.

Focused Learning: Covering Azure Security, AWS Security, GCP Security, DLP, Firewalls, and other key security technologies.

Collaboration & Contribution: Security professionals share experiences, research, and projects.

📌 Featured Projects

🔹 Azure Security: Implementing Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, and Zero Trust in Azure.🔹 AWS Security: Setting up IAM, Security Hub, and threat detection in AWS.🔹 GCP Security: Configuring security controls in Google Cloud.🔹 DLP: Implementing Data Loss Prevention strategies across cloud providers.🔹 Firewall Security: Designing and implementing firewall policies for cloud and hybrid environments.

📖 Using the STAR Method for Projects

Each project should be structured using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to ensure clarity and alignment with real-world security challenges.

STAR Format for Projects

Each project should be documented as follows:

Situation: Describe the real-world security challenge or problem being addressed.

Task: Define the specific security-related goal or objective to be achieved.

Action: Detail the step-by-step process used to solve the problem, including tools, configurations, and techniques.

Result: Explain the outcome, lessons learned, and potential improvements.

Example STAR Format:

Situation: A financial services company faced unauthorized access attempts on its Azure environment.

Task: Implement a Zero Trust model using Azure security controls.

Action: Configured Conditional Access, enabled Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and implemented Just-In-Time (JIT) access.

Result: Unauthorized access attempts were mitigated, and access policies were enforced dynamically.

All contributors should ensure their projects follow this structured format to maintain consistency and maximize learning value.
