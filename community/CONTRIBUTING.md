## 🎯 Goals of Cyber Security DeepDive
- **Hands-On Learning:** Build and document real-world security use cases.
- **Interview Readiness:** Solve security challenges and practice using the **STAR method**.
- **Focused Knowledge Areas:** Cover key security domains such as **Azure Security, AWS Security, GCP Security, DLP, Firewalls**.
- **Collaboration & Contribution:** Security professionals share experiences, research, and projects.

## 📖 Using the STAR Method for Projects
Each project follows the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** to ensure clarity and practical learning.

### **Project Documentation Format (STAR Method)**
1. **Situation:** Describe the real-world security challenge being addressed.
2. **Task:** Define the specific security goal or problem.
3. **Action:** Provide a detailed, step-by-step approach to solving the problem.
4. **Result:** Explain the outcome, key learnings, and potential improvements.

**Example STAR Format:**
- **Situation:** A company faced unauthorized access attempts on its Azure environment.
- **Task:** Implement a Zero Trust model using Azure security controls.
- **Action:** Configured Conditional Access, enabled Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and implemented Just-In-Time (JIT) access.
- **Result:** Unauthorized access attempts were mitigated, and access policies were enforced dynamically.
